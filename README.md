# Magnetic-Tweezers

## Caleb Maddry

## Description
This repository contains my data analysis code for my magnetic tweezers. I have force calibration scripts, data, and data analysis notebooks in here. This NOT a comprehensive repository and is often used as a quick way to generate graphs and figures to look at data. 

At some point I will formalize the code, but for now it is a bit messy. I'm the only person that uses it currently. 
